## Here i'll add my repeated version of codes from the lectures, they might exactly be same as the course [repo](https://github.com/cs50/lectures)

### Notes and slides can be found in this course [website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/)

- lecture-1: C
- lecture-2: Arrays: [notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/2/), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O-Ft7NJln0OYA8veKHDhTurnHrYN67TMaBaTskESnkg/edit?usp=sharing)
- lecture-3: Algorithms: [notes](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/notes/3/), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yIBqjBlJMr_lS7NjADY8Fz0D9hIoy-EJG0dZB7pBPj0/edit#slide=id.gedc48ccb89_0_0)
    1. Pseudo code for **Selection sort**
        - for i from 0 to n-1
            - Find smallest number between numbers[i] and numbers[n-1]
            - Swap the smallest number with numbers[i]
    2. Pseudo code for **Bubble sort**
        - Repeat n times
            - for i from 0 to n-2
                - If numbers[i] and numbers[i+1] are out of order
                    - Swap them
